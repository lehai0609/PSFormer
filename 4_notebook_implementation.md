Of course. Here is a clear, step-by-step guide on how to reorganize your Python project into a Google Colab notebook for predicting stock prices for multiple tickers.

This structure is designed for clarity, ease of use, and debugging. You will create a series of cells, each with a specific purpose.

---

### **How to Structure Your Colab Notebook**

Create a new Google Colab notebook and follow this cell-by-cell organization:

#### **Cell 1: Introduction and Setup**
*   **Type:** Text Cell
*   **Content:** Start with a title like "PSformer for Stock Forecasting" and a brief description of what the notebook does. This is also the perfect place to put the disclaimer that the model uses random weights and needs to be trained for real-world use.
*   **Type:** Code Cell
*   **Content:** Add the code for installing any necessary libraries. Also, include the code to mount your Google Drive, which is a good practice for accessing files.

#### **Cell 2: Upload Your Python and Data Files**
*   **Type:** Text Cell
*   **Content:** Write instructions for the user. Explain that they need to upload all the Python source files (`ps_block.py`, `RevIN.py`, `data_transformer.py`, `attention.py`, `psformer.py`) and their OHLCV data file (`.csv`) to the Colab environment. The easiest way is to use the file explorer pane on the left side of Colab.
*   **Type:** Code Cell
*   **Content:** You can add a code snippet that lists the files in the current directory to verify that everything has been uploaded correctly.

#### **Cell 3: Model and Prediction Configuration**
*   **Type:** Text Cell
*   **Content:** Title this section "Configuration". Explain that this cell holds all the parameters that can be easily changed for different experiments.
*   **Type:** Code Cell
*   **Content:** Define all your global parameters here. This makes it very easy to find and modify settings without digging through the code. This includes:
    *   `DATA_FILE_PATH` (the name of your uploaded CSV file).
    *   `OHLCV_COLUMNS` and a `TICKER_COLUMN` name.
    *   Model hyperparameters: `SEQUENCE_LENGTH`, `PATCH_SIZE`, `PREDICTION_LENGTH`, `NUM_ENCODER_LAYERS`.

#### **Cell 4: Core Model Class Definitions**
*   **Type:** Text Cell
*   **Content:** Title this "PSformer Model Implementation". Explain that the following cells contain the complete source code for the model, adapted for the notebook environment.
*   **Type:** A series of Code Cells (one for each file)
*   **Content:** This is the most important structural change. Create one code cell for each of the Python files you implemented.
    *   **Cell 4a:** Copy the entire contents of `ps_block.py` and paste it here.
    *   **Cell 4b:** Copy the contents of `RevIN.py`.
    *   **Cell 4c:** Copy the contents of `data_transformer.py`.
    *   **Cell 4d:** Copy the contents of `attention.py`. **Crucially, find and delete the line `from .ps_block import PSBlock`** because the `PSBlock` class is now in a cell above and available globally in the notebook.
    *   **Cell 4e:** Copy the contents of `psformer.py`. **Again, remove the local imports** like `from .RevIN import RevIN`, `from .data_transformer import ...`, and `from .attention import ...`.

Excellent. This is a crucial step in evaluating any forecasting model. By holding out the most recent data, you can perform a "backtest" to see how well the model would have predicted the recent past.

Here are the revised instructions for structuring your Colab notebook, focusing on the changes to the prediction loop to incorporate a validation set.

#### **Cell 5: Helper Function for Data Splitting (Revised)**
*   **Type:** Text Cell
*   **Content:** Change the title to **"Helper Function for Data Splitting"**. Explain that this function will now be responsible for separating the time series of each stock into two distinct parts:
    1.  **Model Input:** The historical data the model will use to make a forecast.
    2.  **Validation Ground Truth:** The most recent 30 days of data, which the model will *not* see. This is what we will compare our prediction against.

*   **Type:** Code Cell
*   **Content:** Your revised data preparation function should now do the following:
    1.  Accept a DataFrame of a *single ticker* as input.
    2.  Check if there is enough data for both the `SEQUENCE_LENGTH` and the `PREDICTION_LENGTH` (e.g., at least 96 + 30 = 126 days). If not, it should return `None` for both outputs to signal that this ticker should be skipped.
    3.  **Slice the data:**
        *   The **Validation Set** is the last `PREDICTION_LENGTH` rows of the ticker's data.
        *   The **Model Input Set** is the `SEQUENCE_LENGTH` rows that come *just before* the validation set.
    4.  The function should return these two separate pandas DataFrames: `model_input_df` and `validation_ground_truth_df`.

#### **Cell 6: The Main Prediction and Validation Loop (Revised)**
*   **Type:** Text Cell
*   **Content:** Change the title to **"Run Prediction and Validation Loop"**. Explain that this loop now performs a backtest for each ticker by forecasting the hold-out period and comparing it to the actual known data.

*   **Type:** Code Cell
*   **Content:** This cell will contain your main revised `for` loop. The logic is as follows:
    1.  Load the main CSV file into a DataFrame.
    2.  Get the list of unique tickers.
    3.  Create an empty list to store the validation results for all tickers (`all_validation_results = []`).
    4.  Loop through each unique ticker.
    5.  **Inside the loop:**
        *   Call your new data-splitting function (from Cell 5) for the current ticker. This gives you `model_input` and `ground_truth`.
        *   **Add an `if` statement:** If the function returned `None` (not enough data), print a warning and `continue` to the next ticker.
        *   Instantiate the `PSformerConfig` and `PSformer` model (as before).
        *   Prepare the `model_input` as a PyTorch tensor and run the prediction.
        *   Process the prediction tensor back into a clean DataFrame, `prediction_df`.
        *   **Combine and Compare:**
            *   Reset the index of the `ground_truth` DataFrame so it aligns with the `prediction_df`.
            *   Merge the `ground_truth` (e.g., `Close_actual`) and `prediction_df` (e.g., `Close_predicted`) into a single comparison DataFrame.
            *   Add the ticker symbol as a column to this comparison DataFrame.
        *   Append this final comparison DataFrame to your `all_validation_results` list.

#### **Cell 7: Consolidate, Analyze, and Save Validation Results (Revised)**
*   **Type:** Text Cell
*   **Content:** Change the title to **"Analyze and Visualize Validation Results"**. Explain that this final section will bring all the results together and provide both a quantitative and visual analysis of the model's performance on the hold-out data.

*   **Type:** Code Cell
*   **Content:**
    1.  **Consolidate:** Use `pd.concat()` to combine the `all_validation_results` list into a single, large DataFrame.
    2.  **Quantitative Analysis:**
        *   For each ticker, calculate a simple error metric like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between the `actual` and `predicted` columns.
        *   You can then display a summary table showing the MAE for each ticker and the average MAE across all stocks.
    3.  **Visual Analysis:**
        *   Pick one or two tickers from your results.
        *   Use `matplotlib` or `plotly` to create a line plot showing the **Actual Price** vs. the **Predicted Price** over the 30-day validation period. This is the most effective way to see how well the model captured the trend.
    4.  **Save Results:** Save the consolidated validation DataFrame (with actual and predicted values) to a new CSV file, for example `validation_results.csv`.

This revised structure provides a much more robust and meaningful workflow, allowing you to properly evaluate your model's forecasting capabilities on data it has never seen.
