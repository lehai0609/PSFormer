Looking at the PSformer architecture and the data flow requirements, I need to build a transformation module that handles the critical reshape operations between the standard time series format and PSformer's segment-based representation. Let me break down the design approach and planning.

## Understanding the Transformation Challenge

The core challenge here is converting between two fundamentally different data representations. PSformer's innovation lies in creating "segments" where each segment contains the same temporal patch position across all variables, rather than processing each variable independently. Think of it like reorganizing a bookshelf - instead of keeping all pages of each book together, we're grouping page 1 from all books, page 2 from all books, and so on.

## Design Planning for Data Transformation Module

Here's my systematic approach to building this transformation utility:

### Module Structure Design

```pseudo
CLASS DataTransformationConfig:
    PROPERTIES:
        patch_size: int              # Size of each temporal patch (P)
        sequence_length: int         # Total input sequence length (L) 
        num_variables: int           # Number of time series variables (M)
        num_patches: int             # Calculated: L / P
        segment_length: int          # Calculated: M * P
        
    VALIDATE():
        ASSERT sequence_length % patch_size == 0
        ASSERT patch_size > 0 and num_variables > 0
        CALCULATE num_patches = sequence_length / patch_size
        CALCULATE segment_length = num_variables * patch_size

CLASS PSformerDataTransformer:
    CONSTRUCTOR(config: DataTransformationConfig):
        self.config = config
        self._validate_configuration()
```

### Core Transformation Methods

```pseudo
METHOD create_patches(input_tensor):
    # Transform: [batch, variables, sequence] -> [batch, variables, num_patches, patch_size]
    
    INPUT_VALIDATION:
        ASSERT input_tensor.shape == [batch, M, L]
        ASSERT L == config.sequence_length
        ASSERT M == config.num_variables
    
    ALGORITHM:
        # Reshape sequence dimension to split into patches
        reshaped = RESHAPE(input_tensor, [batch, M, N, P])
        RETURN reshaped
    
    OUTPUT_VALIDATION:
        ASSERT output.shape == [batch, M, N, P]
        ASSERT total_elements_preserved(input_tensor, output)

METHOD create_segments(patched_tensor):
    # Transform: [batch, variables, num_patches, patch_size] -> [batch, num_segments, segment_length]
    
    INPUT_VALIDATION:
        ASSERT patched_tensor.shape == [batch, M, N, P]
    
    ALGORITHM:
        # Step 1: Transpose to put patches before variables
        # [batch, M, N, P] -> [batch, N, M, P]
        transposed = TRANSPOSE(patched_tensor, dims=[0, 2, 1, 3])
        
        # Step 2: Reshape to create segments by concatenating all variables for each patch
        # [batch, N, M, P] -> [batch, N, M*P]
        segments = RESHAPE(transposed, [batch, N, M*P])
        RETURN segments
    
    OUTPUT_VALIDATION:
        ASSERT output.shape == [batch, N, C] where C = M*P
        ASSERT total_elements_preserved(patched_tensor, output)

METHOD restore_shape(segment_tensor, target_sequence_length):
    # Transform: [batch, num_segments, segment_length] -> [batch, variables, sequence]
    
    INPUT_VALIDATION:
        ASSERT segment_tensor.shape == [batch, N, C]
        ASSERT C == config.segment_length
        ASSERT N * config.patch_size == target_sequence_length
    
    ALGORITHM:
        # Step 1: Reshape segments back to separate variables and patches
        # [batch, N, C] -> [batch, N, M, P]
        reshaped = RESHAPE(segment_tensor, [batch, N, M, P])
        
        # Step 2: Transpose to put variables before patches
        # [batch, N, M, P] -> [batch, M, N, P]
        transposed = TRANSPOSE(reshaped, dims=[0, 2, 1, 3])
        
        # Step 3: Reshape to flatten patches back into sequence
        # [batch, M, N, P] -> [batch, M, N*P]
        output = RESHAPE(transposed, [batch, M, target_sequence_length])
        RETURN output
    
    OUTPUT_VALIDATION:
        ASSERT output.shape == [batch, M, target_sequence_length]
        ASSERT total_elements_preserved(segment_tensor, output)
```

### Helper and Validation Methods

```pseudo
METHOD forward_transform(input_tensor):
    # Complete pipeline: input -> patches -> segments
    STEP1: patches = create_patches(input_tensor)
    STEP2: segments = create_segments(patches)
    RETURN segments

METHOD inverse_transform(segment_tensor, target_sequence_length):
    # Complete pipeline: segments -> patches -> output
    RETURN restore_shape(segment_tensor, target_sequence_length)

METHOD validate_dimensions(tensor, expected_shape, operation_name):
    IF tensor.shape != expected_shape:
        RAISE DimensionMismatchError(f"In {operation_name}: expected {expected_shape}, got {tensor.shape}")

METHOD calculate_output_dimensions(input_shape):
    # Given input shape, calculate all intermediate shapes
    batch, variables, sequence = input_shape
    
    patch_shape = [batch, variables, num_patches, patch_size]
    segment_shape = [batch, num_patches, segment_length]
    
    RETURN {
        'patches': patch_shape,
        'segments': segment_shape,
        'segment_length': segment_length,
        'num_segments': num_patches
    }

METHOD verify_transformation_symmetry(input_tensor):
    # Test that forward + inverse = identity (within numerical precision)
    segments = forward_transform(input_tensor)
    restored = inverse_transform(segments, input_tensor.shape[-1])
    
    ASSERT torch.allclose(input_tensor, restored, atol=1e-6)
    RETURN True
```

### Configuration and Factory Methods

```pseudo
METHOD create_transformer_for_psformer(sequence_length, num_variables, patch_size):
    # Factory method with PSformer-specific defaults
    config = DataTransformationConfig(
        patch_size=patch_size,
        sequence_length=sequence_length,
        num_variables=num_variables
    )
    RETURN PSformerDataTransformer(config)

METHOD get_psformer_dimensions():
    # Return the key dimensions that PSformer encoder needs
    RETURN {
        'C': self.config.segment_length,      # This becomes the feature dimension for attention
        'N': self.config.num_patches,         # This becomes the sequence dimension for attention
        'segment_shape': [batch, N, C]        # Final shape for PSformer input
    }
```

## Key Design Principles

The transformation module follows several important principles that ensure it integrates well with both the testing framework and the broader PSformer architecture. The most critical insight is that these transformations are mathematically invertible - no information is lost, only reorganized. This means we can verify correctness by testing the round-trip property.

The module maintains clear separation between configuration, validation, and transformation logic. This makes it easier to test each component independently and ensures that dimension mismatches are caught early with clear error messages.

Finally, the design anticipates integration with PyTorch's autograd system by using only tensor operations that preserve gradient flow, ensuring that the transformation layers don't interfere with backpropagation during training.

This systematic approach ensures that when we implement the actual code, we'll have a robust, testable foundation that correctly handles the complex but crucial data reshaping that makes PSformer's segment attention mechanism possible.
