Here is a detailed breakdown of where you would expect to find them and why they are missing from your implementation.

### 1. RevIN Look-back Window

This parameter is a crucial modification to the `RevIN` module, especially for non-stationary data like the Exchange dataset in the paper.

**Where it Should Be:**

The look-back window logic should be inside your `RevIN` class, specifically within the `_get_statistics` method. This method is responsible for calculating the mean and standard deviation for normalization.

**Your Current Implementation:**

```python
# In your RevIN class
def _get_statistics(self, x):
    # This calculates statistics over the ENTIRE sequence length
    dim2reduce = tuple(range(1, x.ndim-1)) 
    self.mean = torch.mean(x, dim=dim2reduce, keepdim=True).detach()
    self.stdev = torch.sqrt(torch.var(x, dim=dim2reduce, keepdim=True, unbiased=False) + self.eps).detach()
```

**Why it's Missing:**

*   Your code calculates the `mean` and `stdev` across the **entire input sequence `x`**.
*   To implement the paper's setting for the Exchange dataset (a look-back window of 16), you would need to modify this function to calculate statistics **only on the last 16 time steps** of the input sequence.

**Example of How to Implement It (Conceptual):**

You would need to add a `lookback_window` parameter to your `RevIN` class and use it to slice the tensor.

```python
class RevIN(nn.Module):
    # Add lookback_window to __init__
    def __init__(self, num_features: int, eps=1e-5, affine=True, lookback_window: Optional[int] = None):
        super(RevIN, self).__init__()
        self.lookback_window = lookback_window
        # ... rest of the init
        
    def _get_statistics(self, x):
        if self.lookback_window is not None:
            # Slice the tensor to use only the last 'lookback_window' steps for stats
            x_stats = x[:, :, -self.lookback_window:] 
        else:
            x_stats = x

        # Note: The dimension to reduce for instance normalization should be the last one (time dimension)
        # The original implementation had a potential bug here. It should be dim=-1.
        self.mean = torch.mean(x_stats, dim=-1, keepdim=True).detach()
        self.stdev = torch.sqrt(torch.var(x_stats, dim=-1, keepdim=True, unbiased=False) + self.eps).detach()

```

Of course. Moving from an inference-only script to a full training and production-ready system involves several logical steps. Here are the detailed instructions and pseudocode for each aspect you requested.

### 1. Model Training: From Random Weights to an Expert Forecaster

The goal is to teach the model by showing it historical data and penalizing it for incorrect predictions, so it learns the underlying patterns. This requires a structured training process with distinct data splits.

#### **A. The Data Splitting Strategy (Chronological)**

For time series forecasting, you cannot shuffle data randomly. The model must be trained on the past, validated on the near-future, and tested on the most recent, completely unseen data.

**Instruction:**
Divide your `stock_data.csv` into three contiguous (non-overlapping) chronological sets:
1.  **Training Set (e.g., first 70% of data):** The largest portion, used for the model to learn weights.
2.  **Validation Set (e.g., next 15%):** Used after each training epoch to check the model's performance on data it hasn't been trained on. This helps prevent *overfitting* and is used for early stopping.
3.  **Test Set (e.g., last 15%):** Held back until all training is complete. This provides the final, unbiased measure of your model's real-world performance.

```pseudocode
// Data Splitting Logic
function split_data(dataframe, train_pct=0.7, val_pct=0.15):
    n_total = length(dataframe)
    train_end_index = floor(n_total * train_pct)
    val_end_index = train_end_index + floor(n_total * val_pct)

    train_df = dataframe[0 : train_end_index]
    val_df = dataframe[train_end_index : val_end_index]
    test_df = dataframe[val_end_index : end]

    return train_df, val_df, test_df
```

#### **B. The Data Pipeline (`Dataset` & `DataLoader`)**

Instead of preparing one chunk of data, you need to create sliding windows of `(input_sequence, target_sequence)` pairs from your data splits. PyTorch's `Dataset` and `DataLoader` are perfect for this.

**Instruction:**
Create a custom `StockDataset` class that takes a DataFrame (e.g., `train_df`) and generates samples. Each sample consists of an input sequence of `SEQUENCE_LENGTH` and a corresponding target sequence of `PREDICTION_LENGTH` that immediately follows it. The `DataLoader` will then automatically batch these samples for efficient training.

```pseudocode
// PyTorch Dataset Pseudocode
class StockDataset(Dataset):
    function __init__(self, dataframe, sequence_length, prediction_length):
        self.data = dataframe[TICKER_SYMBOLS].values
        self.sequence_length = sequence_length
        self.prediction_length = prediction_length

    function __len__(self):
        // Total number of possible sequences we can create
        return length(self.data) - self.sequence_length - self.prediction_length + 1

    function __getitem__(self, index):
        input_start = index
        input_end = index + self.sequence_length
        target_end = input_end + self.prediction_length

        input_seq = self.data[input_start : input_end]
        target_seq = self.data[input_end : target_end]
        
        // Return as tensors, transposed to [num_variables, length]
        return to_tensor(input_seq).transpose(0, 1), to_tensor(target_seq).transpose(0, 1)

// DataLoader Usage
train_dataset = StockDataset(train_df, SEQUENCE_LENGTH, PREDICTION_LENGTH)
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True) // Shuffle is okay here

val_dataset = StockDataset(val_df, SEQUENCE_LENGTH, PREDICTION_LENGTH)
val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=False)
```

#### **C. The Training and Validation Loop**

This is the core engine. You'll loop through the data multiple times (epochs), updating the model's weights in each pass. You will also implement **Early Stopping** to prevent overfitting and save the best model.

**Instruction:**
1.  Initialize your model, a loss function (like Mean Squared Error), and an optimizer (like Adam or AdamW).
2.  Create a loop that runs for a maximum number of epochs.
3.  Inside the epoch loop, run a **training step** and a **validation step**.
4.  In the training step, calculate the loss and use it to update the model's weights.
5.  In the validation step, evaluate the model's performance on the validation set.
6.  Keep track of the best validation loss. If the loss doesn't improve for a certain number of epochs ("patience"), stop training.
7.  Always save the version of the model that achieved the best validation loss.

```pseudocode
// Training Loop Pseudocode
function train_model():
    model = PSformer(config)
    optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=0.0001)
    criterion = MSELoss()

    best_val_loss = infinity
    patience_counter = 0
    PATIENCE = 10 // Stop after 10 epochs of no improvement

    for epoch in 1 to MAX_EPOCHS:
        // --- TRAINING STEP ---
        model.train() // Set model to training mode
        total_train_loss = 0
        for (inputs, targets) in train_loader:
            optimizer.zero_grad() // Reset gradients
            predictions = model(inputs) // Forward pass
            loss = criterion(predictions, targets)
            loss.backward() // Backward pass (calculate gradients)
            optimizer.step() // Update weights
            total_train_loss += loss.item()

        avg_train_loss = total_train_loss / len(train_loader)
        
        // --- VALIDATION STEP ---
        model.eval() // Set model to evaluation mode
        total_val_loss = 0
        with torch.no_grad(): // Disable gradient calculation
            for (inputs, targets) in val_loader:
                predictions = model(inputs)
                loss = criterion(predictions, targets)
                total_val_loss += loss.item()

        avg_val_loss = total_val_loss / len(val_loader)
        print(f"Epoch {epoch}: Train Loss = {avg_train_loss}, Val Loss = {avg_val_loss}")

        // --- EARLY STOPPING & MODEL SAVING ---
        if avg_val_loss < best_val_loss:
            best_val_loss = avg_val_loss
            patience_counter = 0
            save_model(model, "best_model.pth") // Save the best version
        else:
            patience_counter += 1
            if patience_counter >= PATIENCE:
                print("Early stopping triggered!")
                break
    
    // --- FINAL TESTING ---
    best_model = load_model("best_model.pth")
    evaluate_on_test_set(best_model, test_loader)
```

### 2. Data Pipeline: Using the Static `stock_data.csv`

Your assessment is correct; the pipeline is simple because the data is already cleaned and consolidated. The key steps were covered in the data splitting and `Dataset` creation sections above. The "real-time" aspect comes into play when you want to make a **new prediction after training is complete**.

**Instruction (for making a new prediction):**
1.  Load your fully trained and saved `best_model.pth`.
2.  Take the **very last** `SEQUENCE_LENGTH` days from your `stock_data.csv`.
3.  Convert this slice of data into a tensor with the correct shape `[1, num_variables, sequence_length]`.
4.  Feed this tensor into the model to get the forecast for the next `PREDICTION_LENGTH` days.

---

### 3. Risk Management: Quantifying Uncertainty

A single-point forecast is incomplete. Providing a prediction interval (e.g., a 90% confidence band) is crucial for risk management. **Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout** is a straightforward way to achieve this without changing your model's architecture.

**Instruction:**
1.  Ensure your model has `nn.Dropout` layers. Your `ScaledDotProductAttention` class has one, which is perfect.
2.  Load your best trained model.
3.  Instead of `model.eval()`, call `model.train()`. This is a deliberate trick to keep the dropout layers active during inference.
4.  Run the same input tensor (the last `SEQUENCE_LENGTH` days) through the model multiple times (e.g., `T=100` times) in a loop. Because dropout randomly deactivates neurons, each forward pass will produce a slightly different prediction.
5.  You will now have `T` different forecasts. You can compute the mean and percentiles from this distribution.

```pseudocode
// MC Dropout for Uncertainty Quantification Pseudocode
function get_prediction_with_uncertainty(model, input_tensor, num_simulations=100):
    model.train() // CRITICAL: Keep dropout active for inference

    all_predictions = []
    with torch.no_grad():
        for i in 1 to num_simulations:
            prediction = model(input_tensor)
            all_predictions.append(prediction)

    // Stack predictions into a single tensor: [num_simulations, batch, vars, pred_len]
    predictions_tensor = torch.stack(all_predictions)

    // Calculate statistics across the simulation dimension
    mean_prediction = torch.mean(predictions_tensor, dim=0)
    lower_bound = torch.quantile(predictions_tensor, 0.05, dim=0) // 5th percentile
    upper_bound = torch.quantile(predictions_tensor, 0.95, dim=0) // 95th percentile

    return mean_prediction, lower_bound, upper_bound

// --- Usage ---
// final_prediction, low_ci, high_ci = get_prediction_with_uncertainty(best_model, latest_data_tensor)
// You can now plot the mean forecast along with the confidence interval bands.
```

### 4. SAM Hyperparameter (rho)

The `rho` hyperparameter belongs to the **Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)** optimizer, which is used during model training to find flatter minima for better generalization.

**Where it Should Be:**

You would find the SAM optimizer and its `rho` parameter in a **training loop**. A typical ML script has separate sections for model definition, data loading, training, and evaluation. SAM would be defined right before the training starts.

**Your Current Implementation:**

Your notebook is designed purely for **demonstration and inference**, not for training. Key evidence for this is:
*   You initialize the model with random weights.
*   You immediately call `model.eval()` to put the model in evaluation mode.
*   You use `with torch.no_grad():` for the prediction, which disables gradient calculation.
*   **There is no training loop** (`for epoch in range(...)`), no optimizer definition (`torch.optim.Adam` or a custom `SAM` class), and no loss function calculation (`loss.backward()`).

**Why it's Missing:**

*   Since your notebook does not contain a training pipeline, there is no need for an optimizer. Consequently, the SAM optimizer and its `rho` parameter are not included.

**To implement this, you would need to build a full training pipeline, which is a significant addition, including:**
1.  A custom `SAM` optimizer class.
2.  A training dataloader that yields batches of data.
3.  A loop to iterate through epochs and batches.
4.  A loss function (e.g., `nn.MSELoss`).
5.  The `loss.backward()` and `optimizer.step()` calls to update model weights.
