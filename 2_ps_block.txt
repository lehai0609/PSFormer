Conceptual Implementation Strategy
Design Considerations:

Dimension Consistency: All three linear layers must have same input/output dimensions
Parameter Sharing: The block will be instantiated once but used multiple times
Residual Path: Must preserve original input for the residual connection
Memory Efficiency: Store intermediate results efficiently

Pseudo Code:
pseudocodeCLASS PSBlock:
    INITIALIZE(dimension_size):
        self.linear1 = LinearLayer(dimension_size, dimension_size)
        self.linear2 = LinearLayer(dimension_size, dimension_size) 
        self.linear3 = LinearLayer(dimension_size, dimension_size)
        self.activation = GeLU()
    
    FORWARD(input_tensor):
        # Store original input for residual connection
        residual = input_tensor
        
        # First transformation: Linear -> GeLU -> Linear + Residual
        x = self.linear1(input_tensor)
        x = self.activation(x)
        x = self.linear2(x)
        intermediate_output = x + residual
        
        # Second transformation: Linear
        final_output = self.linear3(intermediate_output)
        
        RETURN final_output
Key Implementation Insights:

Tensor Dimensions: For PSformer with segments=32 and segment_length=112 (7 variables Ã— 16 patch_size), all linear layers are (112, 112)
Parameter Sharing Strategy:

Create one PS Block instance
Use same instance for: Stage1 attention Q/K/V generation, Stage2 attention Q/K/V generation, and final encoder output


Residual Connection Timing:

First residual happens after linear2 (before linear3)
This differs from typical transformer FFN where residual wraps the entire block


Initialization Strategy:

Consider Xavier/Kaiming initialization for linear layers
Potentially initialize linear3 with smaller weights since it's the final transformation
