Of course. As a practitioner of Test-Driven Development, planning a comprehensive test suite before writing the implementation is a critical step. Here is a detailed testing plan for the **Basic Attention Function**, structured into the testing categories you've outlined.

### TDD Plan: Basic Attention Module

This test suite ensures that the fundamental attention mechanism is numerically correct, behaves as expected under various conditions, and is architecturally sound for integration into the larger PSformer model.

---

### CLASS TestBasicAttentionModule

This class encapsulates all tests related to the simple, scaled dot-product attention mechanism.

#### 1. CLASS TestInputValidation

*Purpose: To ensure the attention mechanism is robust against malformed or invalid input data before any computation occurs.*

```pseudo
CLASS TestInputValidation:

    TEST_qkv_shape_compatibility():
        # Test: Ensures Q, K, and V tensors have compatible dimensions for matrix multiplication.
        GIVEN:
            query = tensor of shape [batch, num_queries, embed_dim]
            key = tensor of shape [batch, num_keys, embed_dim]
            value = tensor of shape [batch, num_keys, value_dim]
        WHEN: BasicAttention is called.
        THEN: The function should execute without dimension-mismatch errors.

    TEST_qkv_shape_incompatibility():
        # Test: Asserts that a ValueError is raised for incompatible shapes.
        GIVEN:
            query = tensor of shape [batch, num_queries, dim_1]
            key = tensor of shape [batch, num_keys, dim_2] # dim_1 != dim_2
            value = tensor of shape [batch, num_keys, value_dim]
        WHEN: BasicAttention is called.
        THEN: ASSERT raises ValueError because Q and K embedding dimensions do not match.

    TEST_input_tensor_dtype():
        # Test: Ensures input tensors are floating-point numbers.
        GIVEN: query, key, value tensors with dtype = integer.
        WHEN: BasicAttention is called.
        THEN: ASSERT raises TypeError, as softmax and division are not intended for integers.

    TEST_nan_or_inf_input_handling():
        # Test: Verifies that the presence of NaN/Inf in inputs is handled gracefully.
        GIVEN: A query tensor containing at least one NaN or Inf value.
        WHEN: BasicAttention is called.
        THEN:
            ASSERT the output contains NaN values (as expected).
            # This confirms that the error propagates, preventing silent failures later.
```

#### 2. CLASS TestProcessingLogic

*Purpose: To validate the correctness of each internal computational step of the attention formula.*

```pseudo
CLASS TestProcessingLogic:

    TEST_attention_weights_sum_to_one():

        GIVEN: Any valid query, key, and value tensors.
        WHEN: The internal attention_weights are computed.
        THEN:
            ASSERT torch.allclose(torch.sum(attention_weights, dim=-1), 1.0)
            # This must hold for every query in every batch.

    TEST_scaling_factor_correctness():
        # Test: Isolates and verifies the application of the scaling factor `1/sqrt(dimension)`.
        GIVEN:
            query = tensor([[1., 1.]])
            key = tensor([[1., 1.]])
            # dimension = 4 (for easy sqrt)
        WHEN: The attention scores are calculated before softmax.
        THEN:
            # Expected score = (Q @ K.T) / sqrt(d_k) = (2) / sqrt(4) = 1.0
            ASSERT calculated_score_before_softmax == 1.0

    TEST_output_computation_with_known_weights():
        # Test: Verifies the final matrix multiplication `attention_weights @ value`.
        GIVEN:
            attention_weights = tensor([[0.5, 0.5], [0.1, 0.9]])
            value = tensor([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]])
        WHEN: The final attention output is computed.
        THEN:
            # Expected output[0] = 0.5*[1,2] + 0.5*[3,4] = [2, 3]
            # Expected output[1] = 0.1*[1,2] + 0.9*[3,4] = [2.8, 3.8]
            ASSERT torch.allclose(attention_output[0], expected_output[0])
            ASSERT torch.allclose(attention_output[1], expected_output[1])```

            output_B_separate = BasicAttention(input_B)
            batched_output = BasicAttention(torch.cat([input_A, input_B], dim=0))
        THEN:
            ASSERT torch.allclose(output_A_separate, batched_output[0])
            ASSERT torch.allclose(output_B_separate, batched_output[1])

    TEST_attention_focuses_on_identical_key():
        # Test: A critical sanity check to see if attention "works" intuitively.
        GIVEN:
            query = tensor representing a specific concept, e.g., [10, 10, 10]
            key = tensor with three keys, where the second key is identical to the query.
            # key = [[-1,-1,-1], [10,10,10], [0,0,0]]
        WHEN: attention_weights are computed.
        THEN:
            # The attention weight for the second key should be the highest.
            ASSERT torch.argmax(attention_weights[0]) == 1
```
