Of course. As a TDD practitioner, building a thorough test suite before implementation is critical. Here is a brainstormed set of test scenarios for the **Output Processing Pipeline (Step 4.2 focused)**, presented as pseudo-code.

The plan is based on your project files and strictly adheres to the model description in Section 3.2 of the PSformer paper.

### **Testing Philosophy & Setup**

The "Output Processing Pipeline" consists of three integrated steps: Inverse Transform, Linear Projection, and Inverse RevIN. While our focus is the **Linear Projection**, we must test it within the context of this pipeline. The tests will validate that this specific step behaves as expected and that the entire pipeline is architecturally sound.

**Reference from Paper (Section 3.2, Page 5):**
> "After passing through n layers of the PSformer Encoder, the final output is **X_pred = X_out * W_F**, where ... **W_F ∈ R^(L×F)** is a linear mapping and F is the prediction length."

This equation is the ground truth for our tests. `X_out` is the result of the inverse transform (shape `[B, M, L]`), and `W_F` is our `output_projection` layer.
